## prompt

I need to document a project decision that was made in Jira comments as a formal Confluence decision record.

**Jira Ticket**: {{JIRA_TICKET_KEY}}
**Confluence Template Page**: {{CONFLUENCE_PAGE_URL}}

Please:
1. Analyze the conversation/decision in the Jira ticket comments
2. Fill out the Confluence template page with:
   - Participants (from Jira commenters)
   - Context/background of the decision
   - Discussion topics and key points
   - Final decisions made with rationale
   - Action items and owners
   - References back to Jira and other documentation
3. **üö® CRITICAL: PROVIDE PREVIEW FOR REVIEW BEFORE PUBLISHING üö®**
   - Show me the completed Confluence content for approval
   - Show me the proposed Jira comment for review
   - Wait for my explicit approval before publishing anything
4. Only after approval: Add cross-reference comment to Jira and publish Confluence updates

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Do not publish or update anything until I have reviewed and approved the content.**

This creates bi-directional linking between our project tracking (Jira) and decision documentation (Confluence).
