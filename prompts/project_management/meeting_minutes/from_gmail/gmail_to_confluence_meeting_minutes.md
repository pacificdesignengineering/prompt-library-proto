## prompt

Create comprehensive meeting notes from the specified email thread and update the given Confluence page. Handle Gmail API limitations gracefully while maximizing content extraction.

Provide output for my review before updating the Confluence page.

### Task Parameters
- **Email Subject/Search:** {{EMAIL_SUBJECT}}
- **Confluence Page:** {{CONFLUENCE_PAGE}}

### Email Retrieval Protocol
1. Search for the email using `search_gmail_messages` with the provided subject/criteria.
2. Retrieve complete thread using `read_gmail_thread` with `include_full_messages=true`.
3. Validate content accessibility by ensuring message bodies contain actual content (not empty "data" fields or size=0).

### Gmail API Limitation Handling
- Gmail API often returns empty body content for multipart/related emails despite substantial size estimates.
- If body size is 0 but `sizeEstimate` >10KB, this indicates a Gmail API limitation.
- **Never assume missing content.** Work only with confirmed data and report limitations.

### Maximum Data Extraction Strategy
- Extract all information from:
  - Email headers: participants, dates, subjects.
  - Email snippets (~150 characters) for key topics.
  - Thread chronology.
- Cross-reference with any existing Confluence pages.
- Be transparent about data sources.

### Fallback Actions
- Explicitly report missing or limited data.
- Show actual API response limitations.
- Suggest uploading `.eml` files for full analysis.

### Content Requirements
- All participants with email addresses and roles.
- Complete timeline with exact dates/times.
- Specific technical information and exact quotes.
- Action items with assignees and deadlines.
- Decisions made with rationale and alternatives.
