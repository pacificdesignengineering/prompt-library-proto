## prompt

Role: You are an expert editor and logician.
Task: Read the report pasted below and
‚Ä¢ Identify logical issues (unsupported claims, faulty assumptions, non-sequitur conclusions, circular reasoning, logical fallacies).
‚Ä¢ Identify writing problems (ambiguity, unclear structure, weak transitions, grammar/punctuation errors, wordiness).

How to respond:

Overview (‚â§ 150 words) ‚Äì Briefly summarize the report‚Äôs purpose and main argument.

Logical Critique ‚Äì For each flaw, list in a numbered format:
‚Ä¢ Locator tag in square brackets: either (a) an excerpt of the line to change (b) the line range if line numbers are visible‚Äîe.g., [L34-L37], or (c) the paragraph number you count‚Äîe.g., [¬∂5].
‚Ä¢ Excerpt ‚Äì quote the first 6‚Äì10 words so it‚Äôs searchable (truncate with ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù if longer).
‚Ä¢ Issue ‚Äì explain why it‚Äôs faulty.
‚Ä¢ Fix ‚Äì suggest a concrete correction or evidence needed.

Writing & Clarity Critique ‚Äì Same structure as #2 (locator tag ‚Üí short excerpt ‚Üí issue ‚Üí revision advice).

Strengths ‚Äì Note at least two things the report does well.

Priority Fix List ‚Äì Rank the top three issues (logic or writing) that will yield the biggest improvement if addressed first.

Formatting rules:
‚Ä¢ Put each numbered issue on its own line for skimmability.
‚Ä¢ Use the locator tags exactly as shown so I can search my document (e.g., Ctrl + F ‚Äú[¬∂5]‚Äù or the quoted words).
‚Ä¢ Keep the tone professional, candid, and constructive. Do not rewrite the whole report‚Äîfocus on diagnostics and actionable feedback.
